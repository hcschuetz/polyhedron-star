// The following specification uses JSON5 syntax, which is similar to JSON but
// a bit more permissive.  For example:
// - It supports comments.
// - It allows to omit the quotes around a property key if it is an identifier.
// - It allows trailing commas in objects and arrays.
{
  starGaps: {
      // Each object in this list defines a side of the polygon around the
      // star tips and the corresponding gap between the star's jags.
      // - Each name is used for a polygon side, the corresponding gap,
      //   and the gap's apex (that is, an inward-pointing vertex of the star).
      // - The length and orientation of a polygon side is given as a sequence
      //   of steps.  For example, ["12h", "10h"] means "go one unit in the
      //   "12 o'clock direction" of a clock dial and then one unit in the
      //   "10 o'clock direction".
      //   (A syntax for arbitrary step directions and lengths is also available
      //   but not used here.)
      // - The angleDeficit is the apex angle of the isosceles gap triangle.
      //   It also tells how much rotation is missing to a full 360° turn
      //   when you walk around the corresponding polyhedron vertex or manifold
      //   cone.  (Suffix "deg" or "°" indicates degrees.  Otherwise numbers
      //   are interpreted as radians.)
      //
      // The polygon should be closed
      //
      // This example walks around the polygon in counter-clockwise direction.
      // You can also walk around in clockwise direction.  The direction used
      // here will be called the "positive" direction.
